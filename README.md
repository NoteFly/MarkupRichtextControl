# MarkupRichTextControl
MarkupRichTextControl is a UserControl for .NET to display rich text from a markup formatted text.
The goal of this project is to build a limited Markup implementation that can be used by the NoteFly note taking application for storing and displaying note content.
The limited Markup implementation of MarkupRichTextControl 
can support:
- bold, italic texts;
- strikethough texts;
- headings, with number sign only;
- lists, currently unordered list only;
- hyperlinks;

But is not going to support:
- tables;
- headings, with dashes on next line;
